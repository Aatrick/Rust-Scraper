In the midst of a ruined forest, due to the result of the clash between peak powerhouses, a body of a man lay. He was known as the 'Evilest Villain', the worst man ever born in humanity.His body was full of wounds with a spear piercing his heart. However, even in his final moments, he was calm and collected, with his usual cold face.

The only thing on his mind was, “Forgive me, I couldn't keep my promise to you.”

He closed his eyes, ready to begin his eternal slumber in the darkness.

Suddenly, a blue light appeared, with ancient text that read, 'Do you want to turn back time, my child?'

He laughed and said yes.
